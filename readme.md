# General Assembly Final Project
This repository are the files from my final project in the General Assembly Part-Time Data Science course. My project was focused on predicting the results of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament alongside the Kaggle Competition. In the 'Notebooks' folder, you can find my original exploratory analysis, data wrangling, and modeling work. The 'raw data' folder contains the original data set that I started with. The 'derived data' folder contains the data sets that came out of the notebooks along the way. There is also a PDF of my final presentation.
